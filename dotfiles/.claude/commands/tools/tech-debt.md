## Instructions

### 1. Technical Debt Inventory

Conduct a thorough scan for all types of technical debt:

**Code Debt**
- **Duplicated Code**
  - Exact duplicates (copy-paste)
  - Similar logic patterns
  - Repeated business rules
  - Quantify: Lines duplicated, locations
  
- **Complex Code**
  - High cyclomatic complexity (>10)
  - Deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels)
  - Long methods (>50 lines)
  - God classes (>500 lines, >20 methods)
  - Quantify: Complexity scores, hotspots

- **Poor Structure**
  - Circular dependencies
  - Inappropriate intimacy between classes
  - Feature envy (methods using other class data)
  - Shotgun surgery patterns
  - Quantify: Coupling metrics, change frequency

**Architecture Debt**
- **Design Flaws**
  - Missing abstractions
  - Leaky abstractions
  - Violated architectural boundaries
  - Monolithic components
  - Quantify: Component size, dependency violations

- **Technology Debt**
  - Outdated frameworks/libraries
  - Deprecated API usage
  - Legacy patterns (e.g., callbacks vs promises)
  - Unsupported dependencies
  - Quantify: Version lag, security vulnerabilities

**Testing Debt**
- **Coverage Gaps**
  - Untested code paths
  - Missing edge cases
  - No integration tests
  - Lack of performance tests
  - Quantify: Coverage %, critical paths untested

- **Test Quality**
  - Brittle tests (environment-dependent)
  - Slow test suites
  - Flaky tests
  - No test documentation
  - Quantify: Test runtime, failure rate

**Documentation Debt**
- **Missing Documentation**
  - No API documentation
  - Undocumented complex logic
  - Missing architecture diagrams
  - No onboarding guides
  - Quantify: Undocumented public APIs

**Infrastructure Debt**
- **Deployment Issues**
  - Manual deployment steps
  - No rollback procedures
  - Missing monitoring
  - No performance baselines
  - Quantify: Deployment time, failure rate

### 2. Impact Assessment

Calculate the real cost of each debt item:

**Development Velocity Impact**
```
Debt Item: Duplicate user validation logic
Locations: 5 files
Time Impact: 
- 2 hours per bug fix (must fix in 5 places)
- 4 hours per feature change
- Monthly impact: ~20 hours
Annual Cost: 240 hours × $150/hour = $36,000
```

**Quality Impact**
```
Debt Item: No integration tests for payment flow
Bug Rate: 3 production bugs/month
Average Bug Cost:
- Investigation: 4 hours
- Fix: 2 hours  
- Testing: 2 hours
- Deployment: 1 hour
Monthly Cost: 3 bugs × 9 hours × $150 = $4,050
Annual Cost: $48,600
```

**Risk Assessment**
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk
- **High**: Performance degradation, frequent outages
- **Medium**: Developer frustration, slow feature delivery
- **Low**: Code style issues, minor inefficiencies

### 3. Debt Metrics Dashboard

Create measurable KPIs:

**Code Quality Metrics**
```yaml
Metrics:
  cyclomatic_complexity:
    current: 15.2

class PaymentFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.legacy_processor = LegacyPaymentProcessor()
    
    def process_payment(self, order):
        # New clean interface
        return self.legacy_processor.doPayment(order.to_legacy())

# Phase 2: Implement new service alongside
class PaymentService:
    def process_payment(self, order):
        # Clean implementation
        pass

# Phase 3: Gradual migration
class PaymentFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.new_service = PaymentService()
        self.legacy = LegacyPaymentProcessor()
        
    def process_payment(self, order):
        if feature_flag("use_new_payment"):
            return self.new_service.process_payment(order)
        return self.legacy.doPayment(order.to_legacy())
```
